*. Introduce basic runtime data providers (cookie, request params, etc)
*. Test in prod distribution mode, fix issues, which may occur
*. Try more than first accepted languages, if first one fails then proceed to next
*. push to sonatype and maven central -> requires sbt plugin for gpg preparation, etc
*. Move configs to a static file, now lots of code duplication

Nice to have
*. Convert messages from conf/messages automatically to xliffs
