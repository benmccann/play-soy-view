#play-soy-view


An experimental implementation of Google Closure library support for Play framework 2.2.1

At the moment, this plugin assumes it will be wired via dependency injection, there is no support for including the plugin in plugins file in play that would result in auto wiring. Individual components have to be wired via a dependency injection framework of choice.
