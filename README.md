#play-soy-view

An experimental implementation of Google Closure library support for Play framework 2.2.x for Java

At the moment, this plugin assumes it will be wired via dependency injection, there is no support for including the plugin in plugins file in play that would result in auto wiring.
Individual components have to be wired via a dependency injection framework of choice or alternatively manually wired.

# Example:
https://github.com/mati1979/play-soy-view-example

# Version:
- 0.1 - early adopters only
- 0.1.1 - minor bug fixes

# TODO
- Play 2.3 support

- Move code to java 8

- make it idiomatic for play, make sure ClosurePlugin bootstraps a tree of components, but so that it is reconfigurable later as well

- try to continue putting soy files in app/views, there is an example go to do this based on Freemarker and play integration

- introduce basic runtime data providers (cookie, request params, etc)

- Try more than first accepted languages, if first one fails then proceed to next

- JavaDoc

- Unit Test

- Is this a problem that we are accessing Play application statically

- research if spring bootstrap can be used in library mode

- Support Reverse Router and JavaScript reverse router from Play

- convert messages from conf/messages automatically to xliffs
